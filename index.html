				<h2>Why you need the SAM CHECK to bring your<br> 
				digital marketing plan together!</h2>

				<div class="why-you-need-sem-text pt-lg-3">
					<p>Customers come from anywhere and everywhere: social, search engine, email, word of mouth–and they do a LOT of research online before they buy. Having a consistent online presence gives them confidence to buy (from you!).</p>

					<p>Did you know that 25% of consumers won’t consider a small business they haven’t dealt with before if there’s no digital presence?</p>

					<p>Figuring things out as you go along is a huge time-waster. A clear plan helps streamline your to-do’s and automates what doesn’t need to be done by you!</p>

					<p>Most goals are met by following a plan. In business (and life), success comes from setting goals, then actioning the plan to get there.</p>

					<p>Technology is here to stay. A great digital marketing strategy will outline how to use tech to grow your 
					business–without being tech-savvy.</p>

				<h2>Here’s What Happens If You Don’t Do A Sam Check!
				</h2>

				<p>The reason most people fail when it comes to digital marketing is that they don’t have a plan. Some have a plan, but it usually only addresses one aspect of marketing (social, SEO or content). Others are sporadic and inconsistent with brand communications–this leaves THOUSANDS of DOLLARS on the table.</p>

				<p>Most people give up without a clear strategy because it’s all “too hard”, “confusing” and “overwhelming” to stay on top of. BUT that doesn’t have to be you!</p>

						<p><strong>My name is Anne Neilan.</strong> I work with small businesses to make marketing easy and effective, using data and technology to get more customers and increase sales.</p>

						<p>Before starting Neilan Digital, I worked with big companies like Coke and Danone, growing their online stores to multi-million dollar operations. I realised small businesses could benefit from the tactics those big businesses use to grow, but they didn’t know how –and that’s not fair.</p>

						<p><strong>My mission is to make digital marketing one less thing small businesses have to worry about.</strong></p>

						<p>My vision is for small businesses to be confident using digital marketing to grow and scale, with data and technology part of their everyday marketing toolkit.</p>

						<p>We created SAM because we know the power of digital marketing, and we want you to have fun creating a winning strategy. So grab yours today, and watch your business transform.</p>

						<p>PS. If after completing the SAM Check, you don’t have clarity or focus on your business priorities–email anne@neilandigital.com.au and you’ll get a full refund. No questions asked!</p>
